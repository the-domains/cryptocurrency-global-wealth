Has Bitcoin Matured?

Is Bitcoin the new safe haven currency?

I believe it is, but one last thing you should consider if you're looking to invest in bitcoin. As of late, stock markets have been extremely volatile If and when stock markets suffer a major decline again, bitcoin will become a safe haven investment, as it is at present especially with the latest coup in Turkey, thousands flocked to exchanging fiat currencies for Bitcoin and other Altcoins. If stock markets are hit, people tend to lose faith in financial systems and global fiat currencies. During the GFC recession of 2008, gold prices spiked and people fled paper currencies and stocks and invested their money in gold and other physical assets instead, thus before Bitcoin launched in 2009\.

Predicting the future is difficult, but should stock markets suffer a big hit in the near future (which is very possible), bitcoin prices will spike. As bitcoin is an alternative currency, and because national governments tend to use stimulus policies that deflate the value of their national currencies during economic crises, bitcoin could start to look like a very attractive safe haven as it is at present

This means that bitcoin prices will go up, which is something every investor should understand and consider Bitcoin as a security currency. Should the world suffer a major recession before 2020, bitcoin prices could potentially surge past 2013 record price or even double its estimate. This is pure speculation, of course, and no one knows when the next recession will occur, but if it does Bitcoin is the safe haven currency to have in cold storage.
