Ether Camp Online Hackathon Attracts 500 ProgrammersEther Camp looks forward to this October's four-week hackathon and is inviting anyone to set up a camp, gather a productive team, and code for the $50,000 Ether prize. Not all camps are working with just the \#Ethereum protocol either as \#Bitcoin projects, color coins, and other blockchain technology platforms are encouraged to join as well. ![Hacker 500 Ethereum Camp](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3118d075-d1e9-4336-b6b3-fec8f28ad7b0.jpg)

The hope is the prototypes that form from the camps concepts will bring efficiency to the finance industry, as well as non-financial applications, and improvements to the blockchain ecosystem.
