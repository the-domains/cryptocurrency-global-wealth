Ledger Nano S Review: Can This $65 Device Top Trezor?

Bitcoin.com had the chance to review the new Ledger Nano S multi-cryptocurrency hardware wallet. The Nano S is one of the first hardware wallets that is both compatible with \#Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Ledger has done fairly well for themselves by improving their product line, and the latest release of the Nano S is no different. Older hardware wallets such as the original Ledger, in my opinion, was not as user-friendly like its competitor Trezor. However, after reviewing the Nano S with my seven-year-old son, Joshua, who loves cryptocurrency, we both found the latest offering very easy.
