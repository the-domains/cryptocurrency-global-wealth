But that's ok the upside of mining rigs with Altcoin and Scypt mining particular with Ethereum or Litecoin opportunity is vast, new code, algorithms, and equipment make it possible.

Do you need to be an expert as a CGUMiner? No not at all, a new mindset yes most definitely you need to re-educate yourself learning values to build your own bitcoin / Altcoin / Scryptcoin mining rigs takes time, all you need is a good starting point the right information and being passionate about Cryptocurrency.
