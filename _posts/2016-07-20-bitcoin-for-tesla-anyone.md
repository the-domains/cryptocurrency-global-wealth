Bitcoin for Tesla Anyone?
![â‚¬140,000 Tesla Bought for Bitcoin  https://youtu.be/ECEq35Tr_L0](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ee6dca79-1e9c-47d5-8444-f4bc80c7869b.png)

This is an article from the beginning of the year January 2016 to be precise... so I added as an update that your Bitcoin from seven months ago can buy cars now and will be used soon to buy Real Estate & Property Investment. With businesses joining Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies around the world, we see a mass move in the Virtual Monetary Economy thanks to China, Brexit, and the failed Turkish coup which has seen many Turkish consumers buying in on Bitcoin over the past few days.

So here it is Bitcoin no matter what you think of it positive or negative.. the past and latest geopolitical events is making Bitcoin a stable currency to be reckon with.
