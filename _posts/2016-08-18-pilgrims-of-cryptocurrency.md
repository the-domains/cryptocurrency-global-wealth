  There has been so much controversy over Bitcoin in 2016, the surge of Bitcoins
  price in May the halving of Bitcoin in June, stagnant volatility in July and
  the online hack attack on Bitfinex in August… could Bitcoin be losing its
  status as trustworthy? I dont think so! Why because Bitcoin is here to stay,
  with hundreds of thousands of businesses and millions of individual investors
  globally using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency alternatives, the advance in
  ‘The Blockchain’ is the golden key to making Bitcoin a stronger commodity
  against the fiat. Global economic analysis predict a crash of the US Dollar
  late in September, this could be the advantage Bitcoin has been waiting for,
  could it lead to an all time record surge bigger than November 2013.
